PART II

1. You can scroll either with the mouse or use D to go down half a page, use U to go up half a page, and Q to exit.

2. -l flag lists files in a long format. -a flag includes directory entries whose names begin with a dot.

3. option + arrow keys

4. control + e

5. control + a

6. control + w

7. terminal is a text input and output environment and shell processes commands and outputs the results.

8. absolute path goes from root of the directory and gives every route name to a file/folder location.

9. relative path goes from the current location to a file/folder location on the same path. You do not need to list all the route names to the target location.

10. flag gives additional options to a command. Some examples of flags I've used are -a to see everything including hidden folder/files. rm -rf to remove folders with files still inside without confirmation. -l to see modification date/time for files/folders.

11. rm -r attempts to remove the file with the implication of -d (removes directories as well as files).
    rm -f attempts to remove the files without confirmation.
