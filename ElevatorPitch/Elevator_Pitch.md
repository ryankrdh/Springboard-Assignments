Hi! Nice to meet you!

My name is Ryan and I'll be graduating from Springboard in June of 2022.

I am looking for a software engineering position in Seattle and I'm particularly interested in working for startup-like environments where I can grow fast.

I have experience in programming full-stack applications, working mainly on back-end.

I am very team-driven and passionate, and I'm sure I'll be a great addition to your team.

Would you be interested in connecting with me to discuss any opportunities?
